# ðŸŽ¨ Random Color Palette Generator in Flutter

A small project proposed by [DevProjects](https://www.codementor.io/projects) for beginners in Flutter. The project details and requirements are available in the provided link. As suggested, I utilized the [ColorMind API](http://colormind.io/api-access/), a free REST API, to fetch color palettes.

To enhance the project, I added a few extra challenges. One of these was enabling users to save a generated palette. To achieve this, I used [Shared Preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) to store the palette data, which can then be accessed on another page titled 'Your Palettes'. Another feature I implemented is the ability to copy the hex code of a specific color to the clipboard by clicking on it.

Additionaly, I integrated [Flutter Toast](https://pub.dev/packages/fluttertoast) to display useful notifications throughout the app.
